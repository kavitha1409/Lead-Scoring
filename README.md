# Lead-Scoring
X Education, an online education company, caters to industry professionals by offering a range of courses. When professionals visit the website, they explore available courses and fill out forms to express interest. These actions classify them as leads.
Subsequently, the sales team engages in activities like calls and emails to convert these leads into customers. However, not all leads end up converting.
Typically, X Education experiences a lead conversion rate of approximately 30%. In simpler terms, out of 100 acquired leads, about 30 get converted into customers.
To enhance efficiency, the company aims to pinpoint the most promising leads, often referred to as "Hot Leads." By focusing efforts on these potential leads, the goal is to increase the lead conversion rate. This strategic shift should result in more effective communication and a higher conversion rate compared to reaching out to all leadsÂ uniformly.
